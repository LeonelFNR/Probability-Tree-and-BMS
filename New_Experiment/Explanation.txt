Generate Datasets with the Nguyen dataset plus some experimental error
Generate random expressions with a default generated probability tree
For each generated expression:
    Wiht a BMS generated with the expression and the dataset
    Compute the .sse, .bic, .energy to get the description length
    Compute the probability of generating that expression
Scatter plot the results

Then: 
With the obtained expressions and description lenghts
Train a new ProbTree via KL Divergence decrease.
Scatter plot the probabilites with new probtree vs. the description length
