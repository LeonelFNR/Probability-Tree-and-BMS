This repository contains de code used for my Bachelor's Degree Thesis and the field of symbolic regression. The objective was to propose and develop a new way to explore the sample space (propose functions) faster and more efficiently.

This repository contains the code of the paper:

Guimera, R, Reichardt, I, Aguilar-Mogas, A, Massucci, FA, Miranda, M, Pallares, J, Sales-Pardo, M. [A Bayesian machine scientist to aid in the solution of challenging scientific problems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aav6971), Sci. Adv. 6 (5) , eaav6971 (2020).

And additional structures that were added for my thesis. These modifications can be found in the mcmc.py file.
